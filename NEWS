* Update RPM BuildRequires for tcmalloc's package rename in EPEL.

=========================================================================
Release Notes for DIOD version 1.0.9                          12 Mar 2012
=========================================================================

Release Notes for DIOD version 1.0.7                          07 Mar 2012
=========================================================================

* Change statfs to return f_type == V9FS_MAGIC by default, and add
  statfs_passthru = 1 config to get old behavior (issue 80)

* Relax kern/t14 to work around 32 bit f_fsid issue (high byte -1)
  and allow f_type to be V9FS_MAGIC (issue 54)

=========================================================================

* Set maxmmap=0 by default as no performance benefit has been
  demonstrated and it increases our VM footprint.

=========================================================================

* Add 'maxmmap' tunable which will mmap the first 'maxmmap' bytes of
  a shared file as a performance optimization for parallel reads
  (default 4194304).  This option only affects file systems exported
  with the 'sharefd' attribute.

=========================================================================

=========================================================================

* Fix locking problem in new ioctx code (issue 97)
  This was causing the server to assert occasionally under load.

=========================================================================

=========================================================================
Release Notes for DIOD version 1.0.1                          24 Feb 2012
=========================================================================

* Add 'sharefd' export option which enables limited server-side
  sharing of file descriptors for files opened read-only.  The default
  is (still) for every client open to trigger a server open.

=========================================================================
Release Notes for DIOD version 1.0.0                          17 Feb 2012
=========================================================================
