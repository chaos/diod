These are all unit tests that can be run without risk of crashing
the machine they are running on.

t00(*)	Show that pthreads can independently setfsuid/setfsgid.
	This is a strategy for handling the I/O of multiple users in
	threaded work crew.
t01(*)	Show that supplementary groups work as advertised when
	setfsuid/setfsgid being used.
t02(*)	Check that pthreads can independently setgroups.
	This is a strategy for handling the I/O of multiple users in
	a threaded work crew.
t03(*)	Demonstrate that pthreads cannot independently seteuid/setegid.
	This was the original npfs strategy for handing I/O of multiple
	users in a threaded work crew.  Not valid post-linuxthreads.
t04	Demonstrate that fcntl advisory locking does not treat threads
	like individual procesess, e.g. locks are shared among threads.
	This means a threaded work crew cannot manage fcntl locks on behalf
	of multiple remote processes.
t05	Unit test for diodmount option handling module.
t06(@)	Unit test for parsing diod.conf.
t07   	Check for memory problems in libnpfs serialize/deserialize
t08(@)	Check for memory problems in libdiod conf/log
t09   	Check for memory problems in list package
	Actually this was to run down a specific case, now fixed.
t10	Check for memory problems in a skeletal libnpfs client/server
t11(*)	Show that pthreads can independently set/clear CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE
t12     Check for memory problems in fidpool
t13	Check for memory problems in client/server with diod ops
t14(*)	Check for memory problems in client/server with user switching

(*) NOTRUN if not run as root
(@) NOTRUN if lua is not installed
