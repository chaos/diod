These all run the same way:
- Makefile sets up environment and invokes test through ./runtest wrapper.
- ./runtest runs ./conjoin "diod -e ./exp.d ..." "<test> ./exp.d"
  (conjoin sets up a socketpair and runs test on one end, server on the other)
- output goes to <test>.out
- diod log goes to <test>.diod
- <test>.out is compared with <test>.exp 

The tests are:
t01	Simple mount/unmount sanity test.
t02	Mount attempt on aname that's not exported
t03	Read a file out of 9p and check integrity
t04	Try to read a non-existent file.
t05	Write a file into 9p and check integrity
t06	Try to write file in non-existent directory.
t07	Simple mkdir
t08	Compare p9 stat with regular stat
t09	Create directory >P9_MAXWELEM directories deep.
t10	Attach to server with N threads, 1 user
t11(*)	Attach to server with N threads, M users (N > M)
t12(+)  Attach to user A's private server with user B
t13(*)	Attach to server with N threads, M users (N < M)
t15	Check that flush works the way it ought to.
