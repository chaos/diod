.SH NAME
mount.diod \- mount diod file systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmount.diod\fR \fI[OPTIONS] host[:aname] dir [-o options]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mount.diod
is the mount utility for the distributed I/O daemon, which is an I/O
forwarding service for Linux clusters built upon the Linux \fB9p\fR
file system.
.LP
\fBmount.diod\fR performs two main tasks:
1) connect and authenticate to the \fBdiod\fR server, and
2) issue the \fImount(2)\fR system call with appropriate mount options.
.LP
Authentication with the \fBdiod\fR server takes place in user space.
The connected (and authenticated) file descriptor is passed as a mount
option to the kernel \fB9p\fR file system
.LP
This command requires root to execute the \fImount(2)\fR system call.
.LP
The \fB9p\fR file system must support the 9P2000.L protocol variant,
e.g. kernel 2.6.38 or above.
.LP
The \fIhost\fR portion of the mount spec may optionally be supplied in
hostlist format, e.g. host1,host2,host3:aname or host[1-3]:aname, in which
case hosts are tried in order until a successful connection is obtained.
Post-connect mount errors are immediately fatal.
.LP
If the \fIhost\fR portion of the mount spec begins with a forward-slash (/),
it refers to the path to a UNIX domain socket.
.LP
IPv6 addresses may be used for the \fIhost\fR portion of the mount spec if they
are enclosed in square brackets.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.TP
.I "-f, --fake-mount"
Do everything except the mount system call.
.TP
.I "-n, --no-mtab"
Do not update the system mtab.
.TP
.I "-v, --verbose"
Set verbose mode.
.TP
.I "-o, --options opt[,opt,...]"
Set mount options (see below).
.TP
.I "-p, --privport"
Connect from a socket bound to a port in the range of 512-1023,
available to root only.  This can be used in conjunction with the
\fIprivport\fR export option.
.SH MOUNT OPTIONS
For a complete list of v9fs mount options, refer to the kernel
documentation at https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/9p.html.
Some common options are described below.
.TP
.I "aname=PATH"
The aname is the path of the exported file system on the server.
It can be specified in the mount spec in \fIhost:aname\fR format
like NFS, or it can be specified with this option.
\fBdiod\fR will not allow an attach to an empty aname.
\fBdiod\fR has a built-in synthetic control file system that can be
mounted with aname of \fIctl\fR.
Note that "ctl" must be explicitly exported.
.TP
.I "uname=USERNAME"
The user name to authenticate to the \fBdiod\fR server.
If neither \fIuname\fR nor \fIaccess\fR are specified,
\fIuname=root,access=client\fR is assumed.
.TP
.I "access=client"
The client allows any user to access the file system and enforces access
control.  Each new user attaches to the server.
Requires \fIuname=root\fR.
.TP
.I "access=user"
The same as \fIaccess=client\fR, but a weaker guarantee that the client
performs access control.  \fBdiod\fR users are encouraged to use
\fIaccess=client\fR.
Requires \fIuname=root\fR.
.TP
.I "access=UID"
The client only allows UID to access the filesystem.
Only the authenticated user attaches to the server.
.TP
.I "access=any"
The client allows any user to access the filesystem.
Only the authenticated user attaches to the server.
.TP
.I "posixacl"
Enforce POSIX access control lists.
Requires \fIuname=root\fR and \fIaccess=client\fR.
.TP
.I "port=N"
Connect to the \fIdiod\fR server on the specified port.
The default is the IANA-assigned 9pfs port 564.
.TP
.I "trans=fd"
Select a transport.
\fBmount.diod\fR only supports \fItrans=fd\fR
because of its strategy for authentication.
.TP
.I "rfdno=N,wfdno=N"
The file descriptor for reading and writing with \fItrans=fd\fR.
If set, \fBmount.diod\fR assumes this file descriptor is already
connected to a \fBdiod\fR server and ignores \fIhost\fR in the
device specification, and the \fIport=n\fR option.
.TP
.I "msize=N"
The msize is the max 9P packet payload size.
The default is 65512 (65536-24)
.TP
.I "version=9p20000.L"
Select 9P protocol version.
\fBdiod\fR only supports \fI9p2000.L\fR.
.TP
.I "cache=MODE"
Specify a caching policy.
Cache modes include \fInone\fR (default), \fIreadahead\fR, \fImmap\fR,
\fIloose\fR, and \fIfscache.
.TP
.I "debug=MASK"
Specifies debug level for the kernel 9p module.  The debug level is a bitmask.
.br
0x01  = display verbose error messages
.br
0x02  = developer debug (DEBUG_CURRENT)
.br
0x04  = display 9p trace
.br
0x08  = display VFS trace
.br
0x10  = display Marshalling debug
.br
0x20  = display RPC debug
.br
0x40  = display transport debug
.br
0x80  = display allocation debug
.br
0x100 = display protocol message debug
.br
0x200 = display Fid debug
.br
0x400 = display packet debug
.br
0x800 = display fscache tracing debug
.br
The debug level is global, i.e. it applies to all 9P file systems and
it remains set after the file system is unmounted.
The default is \fIdebug=0\fR.
